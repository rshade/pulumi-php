# pulumi-php

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Pulumi supports several languages for infrastructure as code (IaC), including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, and .NET (C# and F#). While PHP isn't officially supported by Pulumi, it's interesting to imagine what a resource constructor might look like in PHP.
Here are some possible options, assuming we're creating an instance of a `PulumiAwsS3Bucket` resource. Note that these are hypothetical examples; Pulumi's actual implementation could differ significantly if they ever do support PHP.

## Option 1: Using associative arrays for arguments

```php
$bucket = new Pulumi\Aws\S3\Bucket("myBucket", [
    'acl' => 'public-read',
    'tags' => [
        'Environment' => 'Dev',
        'Name' => 'My bucket'
    ]
]);
```

## Option 2: Fluent interface

```php
$bucket = (new Pulumi\Aws\S3\Bucket('myBucket'))
    ->setAcl('public-read')
    ->setTags(['Environment' => 'Dev', 'Name' => 'My bucket']);
```

## Option 3: Using constructor and separate setter methods

```php
$bucket = new Pulumi\Aws\S3\Bucket("myBucket");
$bucket->setAcl('public-read');
$bucket->setTags([
    'Environment' => 'Dev',
    'Name' => 'My bucket'
]);
```

## Option 4: Using a static method for creation

```php
$bucket = Pulumi\Aws\S3\Bucket::create('myBucket', [
    'acl' => 'public-read',
    'tags' => [
        'Environment' => 'Dev',
        'Name' => 'My bucket'
    ]
]);
```

## Option 5: Using a builder pattern

```php
$bucket = Pulumi\Aws\S3\Bucket::builder()
    ->name('myBucket')
    ->acl('public-read')
    ->tags([
        'Environment' => 'Dev',
        'Name' => 'My bucket'
    ])
    ->build();
```

Remember, these are just hypothetical examples of how a Pulumi resource constructor might look in PHP. The actual implementation would depend on a variety of factors, including PHP's language features, the design of the Pulumi SDK, and the specific needs of the resources being managed.
